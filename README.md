# FizzBuzz js weekend challenge - week 2

In this challenge, we are revisiting the fizzbuzz kata, but in JS! We are also bringing back the training wheel testing package to write tests to our code. As the final part of the challenge, you need to deploy your website using GitHub pages.

### Learning Objectives: 

[ ] Ability to explain concepts

[X] Practice JS

[ ] Combine both feature and unit test and understand their difference

[ ] Read and understand documentation

[ ] Debug and find errors

### What we are expecting to see in your implementation: 

[ ] A deployed website with some styling

[ ] All test are going green

[ ] Good and readable commits messages commits made after every test going green or when you have added implementation code

[X] Usage of branches

[ ] A PR towards your own master branch

[ ] Answers to the questions in the README

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Initiate npm with the npm init command in your terminal to create a package.json file. 

We'll be useing the e2e training wheels for testing our code. This provides a minimal test enviroment setup and a set of convinient helpers to be used in acceptance (end-2-end) tests. Install the training wheels by following the instructions on https://www.npmjs.com/package/e2e_training_wheels. 

### Installing

Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your computer
3. Install dependencies yarn install
4. Run the tests yarn test
5. Add your implementation of the FizzBuzz to src/FizzBuzz.js to get all tests to pass
Once you're done with the challenge, commit your work and submit a pull request against the upstream repository.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

## Deployment

Deploy your index.html on your GitHub pages, by enabling this feature from the "settings" tab of your repository on GitHub.com.
